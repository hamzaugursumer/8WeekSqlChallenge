### 8 Week SQL Challenge

![img](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/8-week-sql-challenge.png)

I showcase my sql skills in these 8 weekly sql cases created by Danny Ma. This repository contains solutions for the first case. I created it in Turkish because there may be people who want to use and benefit from the resource.

* Solutions were made with PostgreSQL.
* The repository contains ERD, tables and schema.
* There are introduction and problem definition sections for you to do the questions.

* Don't forget to give a ‚≠ê.
